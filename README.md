# HL GIS project Spatial Data ETL

This work is for the HL GIS and survey project.
Everyday, we would receive many spreasheet files and need to clean, extract and covert them to GIS format file.
In order to keeping the same data format not only for the spreadsheet but also for the GIS file, therefore, creating a foundation ETF script is important for this project.
